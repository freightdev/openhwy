# 🦉📖 Marker Tales

### 1. **Every Project is a Tale writen with markers**

* Not a case study.
* Not a portfolio item.
* A **Tale**: alive, being told, being built.
* Some are public.
* Some are secret.

> 🔹 **"What tale are you working on today?"**
> → That’s workflow. Dev flow. Identity. Ownership.

### 2. **Tales Have States**

Each Tale has a **mark** writen with **markers**. The marker determines how it behaves.

| State            | Meaning                                   | Visibility        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 🕊️ `open`       | Client has made it public                 | Fully visible     |
| 🧪 `in-progress` | Being built, possibly collaborative       | Partially visible |
| 🔒 `private`     | Hidden. Only visible to client/dev team   | Hidden            |
| 🧭 `archived`    | Tale is closed, but lives in the vault    | Read-only         |
| ✍️ `draft`       | Started, but not yet marked for the world | Local to team     |

### 3. **Tales Are Written in Real-Time**

Each time you make progress, the system writes:

* A paragraph
* A code snippet
* A mark
* A lesson
* A log

This is the **Builder’s Tale**, the **Marketeer’s Tale**, the **Driver’s Tale**.
You swipe between them like flipping through story scrolls.

---

### 4. **Client-Controlled Visibility**

Clients can:

* Approve tales for the public
* Lock some forever
* Allow parts to be used for investors (proof-of-progress)

---

### 5. **Developer/Community Tales**

Not just client work.

* A developer writes a tale of how they built an API.
* A trucker writes how they survived a tough route.
* A marketer writes a tale of a campaign that worked.

You create **identity-bound, knowledge-sharing narratives**.

> Every contributor becomes part of the vault.

---

### 6. **Marketeer is the marker Behind the Tales**

> **"Marketeer writes the tale. The tale is a log. A journal. A memory."**

* Logging marks in each tale
* Attaching them to agents, clients, or projects
* Becoming the Owl of the system

---

### 7. **Each Tale Is a Tiny Vault**

Every tale contains:

* 📜 Markdown entries
* 🔖 Mark logs
* 🧩 Packages used
* 🔄 Timeline of changes
* 🌐 Public/Private status
* 📣 Optional investor hooks
* 🧠 Training data for agent memory

> You are **literally storing knowledge** in a form AI *and humans* can both read.

## 💡 Philosophically

Turn “work” into **narrative artifacts**.

Turn “clients” into **characters in living books**.

Turn “deliverables” into **chapters**, **tales**, and **legacies**.

And Marketeer is the **scribe**.
